# Pretty .bashrc
Custom .bashrc for linux and WSL

Two-line prompt:<br/>
   user@host [HH:MM] dir<br/>
   *   └──────────────┴──$

Ignore the dot at the begining, that was the only way I could find to line it up here.

Colors:
*  user/host   = green (non-root) / red (root)<br/>
*  time        = uncolored (fixed width and bracketed HH:MM)<br/>
*  dir         = blue (writable) / red (non-writable)<br/>
*  arrow       = dir color<br/>
*  prompt char = user color<br/>
