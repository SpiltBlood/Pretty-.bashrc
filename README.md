# Pretty .bashrc
Custom .bashrc for linux and WSL

Two-line prompt:<br/>
   user@host [HH:MM] dir<br/>
   *   └──────────────┴──$

Ignore the dot at the begining, that was the only way I could find to line it up here.

Colors:
   user/host   = green (non-root) / red (root)
   time        = uncolored (fixed width and bracketed HH:MM)
   dir         = blue (writable) / red (non-writable)
   arrow       = dir color
   prompt char = user color
